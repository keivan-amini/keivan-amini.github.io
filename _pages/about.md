Hi everyone! ðŸ˜‰
======

My name is Keivan, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at **Sorbonne UniversitÃ©** and at **Ã‰cole SupÃ©rieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles** in Paris. I am affiliated with the [Institut des SystÃ¨mes Intelligents et de Robotique](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/?lang=en) and the [Gulliver Laboratory](https://www.gulliver.espci.fr/?-home-), where I am jointly supervised by Prof. [Nicolas Bredeche](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/bredeche/?lang=en) and Prof. [Olivier Dauchot](https://gulliver.spip.espci.fr/?olivier-dauchot-128).

My research
======

The title of my PhD thesis is *Physics of Distributed Learning Dynamics in a Swarm of Mobile Robots*. My research explores the intersection of **statistical physics**, **machine learning**, and **swarm robotics**. Specifically, I design and conduct learning experiments using [Pogobots](https://pogobot.github.io/) --- a small-scale platform developed for swarm robotics.

My work involves modeling their collective behavior as active brownian particles to better understand the underlying dynamics of distributed learning in multi-agent systems. In this project we complement theoretical modeling with experimental validation, with the aim to study collective intelligence and adaptive behavior in decentralized systems.

Interests
======

* **Stochastic Processes** ðŸ“ˆ
* **Multidisciplinary Research** ðŸ§ 
* **Machine Learning** ðŸ¤–

Indeed, my interests are very general and span a wide range of topics. During my studies I had the opportunity to work on several different projects, ranging from reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction to the analysis of multi-omics high-throughput data using network-based and stochastic approaches, as well as swarm robotics.

Thus, one of my key strengths is my ability to adapt and dive into new fields. While it often takes time to familiarize myself with a new domain, I consistently succeed in making my (small!) contributions.

Personal info
======

I was born in 1999 in Ferrara, Italy, with a persian dad and a sicilian mum. For this reason, I speak fluently italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ and english ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, while I have basic french ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and farsi ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·.
