This work was the result of my MSc Research Internship at Sorbonne Université after I won an Erasmus+ scholarship. It has a great emotional value for me, for mainly three reasons:

1. For the first time in my life, I found myself truly out of my comfort zone: living in a big city like Paris, where Italian is not the primary language, and where I had no friends. Moreover, I did not know anything about Reinforcement Learning, so I passed like the first 3 weeks of the Internship studying Sutton & Barto!
2. I really wanted to do this internship, and completely obtained by myself, without the help of nobody.
3. I loved working with Augustin, Benoît and Mehdi ❤️ and I think we did a cool job all together.

I also wrote my MSc thesis on this project, which can be downloaded [here](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/id/eprint/30062/).
